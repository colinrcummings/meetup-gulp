# Managing environment workflows with gulp.js

A presentation for the [Worcester Web Technology](https://www.meetup.com/Worcester-Web-Technology/) Meetup group built with [Spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle) by [Colin Cummings](https://colinrcummings.github.io).

## Development

`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Build

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. The app is ready to be deployed!

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

`npm run deploy`

## Boilerplate

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `src/index.js` (JavaScript entry point)
* `public/index.html` (page template)

For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack. You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, or Webpack wonâ€™t see them.

Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.
